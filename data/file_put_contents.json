    "Description": "Description\n\nint file_put_contents ( string $filename , mixed $data [, int $flags = 0 [,\nresource $context ]] )\nThis function is identical to calling fopen(), fwrite() and fclose()\nsuccessively to write data to a file.\nIf filename does not exist, the file is created. Otherwise, the existing file\nis overwritten, unless the FILE_APPEND flag is set.\n",
    "Parameters": "Parameters\n\n  filename\n      Path to the file where to write the data.\n  data\n      The data to write. Can be either a string, an array or a stream resource.\n      If data is a stream resource, the remaining buffer of that stream will be\n      copied to the specified file. This is similar with using\n      stream_copy_to_stream().\n      You can also specify the data parameter as a single dimension array. This\n      is equivalent to file_put_contents($filename, implode('', $array)).\n  flags\n      The value of flags can be any combination of the following flags, joined\n      with the binary OR (|) operator.\n                                   Available flags\n      Flag                  Description\n      FILE_USE_INCLUDE_PATH Search for filename in the include directory. See\n                            include_path for more information.\n      FILE_APPEND           If file filename already exists, append the data to\n                            the file instead of overwriting it.\n      LOCK_EX               Acquire an exclusive lock on the file while\n                            proceeding to the writing.\n  context\n      A valid context resource created with stream_context_create().\n",
    "Return Values": "Return Values\n\nThis function returns the number of bytes that were written to the file, or\nFALSE on failure.\nWarning\nThis function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean value\nwhich evaluates to FALSE. Please read the section on Booleans for more\ninformation. Use the_===_operator for testing the return value of this\nfunction.\n",
