    "return": "return\n\n(PHP 4, PHP 5)\nreturn returns program control to the calling module. Execution resumes at the\nstatement following the called module's invocation.\nIf called from within a function, the return statement immediately ends\nexecution of the current function, and returns its argument as the value of the\nfunction call. return also ends the execution of an eval() statement or script\nfile.\nIf called from the global scope, then execution of the current script file is\nended. If the current script file was included or required, then control is\npassed back to the calling file. Furthermore, if the current script file was\nincluded, then the value given to return will be returned as the value of the\ninclude call. If return is called from within the main script file, then script\nexecution ends. If the current script file was named by the auto_prepend_file\nor auto_append_file configuration options in php.ini, then that script file's\nexecution is ended.\nFor more information, see Returning_values.\n     Note:  Note that since return is a language construct and not a\n     function, the parentheses surrounding its arguments are not required.\n     It is common to leave them out, and you actually should do so as PHP\n     has less work to do in this case.\n     Note:  If no parameter is supplied, then the parentheses must be\n     omitted and NULL will be returned. Calling return with parentheses\n     but with no arguments will result in a parse error.\n     Note:  You should never use parentheses around your return variable\n     when returning by reference, as this will not work. You can only\n     return variables by reference, not the result of a statement. If you\n     use return ($a); then you're not returning a variable, but the result\n     of the expression ($a) (which is, of course, the value of $a).\n[add_a_note]_add_a_note\n"
